grades
======
This is a (now mothballed) project to calculate the required exam grade to achieve a degree classification.

I originally made it for my fellow coursemates to help them work out what exam grade they'd need to get to achieve, for example, a first in a particular module.

It was built with Gumby Framework (similar to Bootstrap) and was one of the first mini-projects I made while learning SCSS / Sass.
